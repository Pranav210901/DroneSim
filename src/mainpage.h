 * A brief description of the project: 
 *
 * This projectâ€™s main purpose is to create a drone simulation that uses an image processing subsystem to search 
 * for an object in a scene. A web-based visualization system that allowed us  to interact with  the simulation was 
 * given and the task was to find a robot hidden in the scene using a combination of drone movement and an image 
 * processing subsystem. The drone has a camera class that takes pictures of what the drone is looking at as it 
 * moves around the scene. The visualization offers two images from the drone camera when a picture is taken. The
  * first image is a color image, and the second is a depth image (showing direction and distance to the object). 
  * These two images,  well as the image processor subsystem, are used to locate the robot and direct it to its 
  * destination. A detailed description of the overall structure of the project including the two subsystems and 
  * applications is provided  in the \ref OverviewPage "OverviewPage". 
* The two main subsystems of the project were the image processor and the simulation. The image processor 
* implemented the computer vision techniques to find the robot in an image and  the simulation system  
* connected everything together with the web-app.
* The image processing subsystem is further discussed in the \ref Image_processing  "Image_Processing" Section  and
  * simulation is discussed in greater detail in the \ref SimulationPage "SimulationPage" SECTION. During the  development process our team used 
* github as a aversion controller to collaborate. The timeline of this project was divided into three iterations 
* and an agile scrum process was followed by our team members within each iteration. How the overall contribution 
* went  with the project in each iteration is further discussed in the \ref how_to_contribute "HOWTOCONTRIBUTE" 
* section. Lastly, the \ref Getting_Started "Getting_started" page have details on how to clone, build, and run 
* the project.
